    FINAL: create 3 variables of a class A, ballSize, ballColour, ballTexture.
    and make it impossible to change the value the ballSize in any method in that class

    STATIC: I want to use the value of a variable in one class in another class
    at runtime. I also want to access the variable without creating an object of
    its class. Help me implement this

    SUPER: Class B is extending Class A, Class B has a variable String name = "Anderson"
    while Class A has the same varible name and type is an attribute "Ronke".
    Print out the value of Class A and class B in your main method using the object
    of only One class. (Dont create two objects).

    THIS https://i.imgur.com/aRkRDPa.png You have a class with a method printName.
    write a code in the printName method that will print the instance member which
    is "Delta" and whatever name the user enter when invoking the method
